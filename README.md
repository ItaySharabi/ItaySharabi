### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Itay!
    I am currently a Computer Science and Mathematics student (Second year).
    
    
- ðŸ“« Here you'll find: 
      Some complex java and python projects using the OOP approach, like 
      a game of Pokemons, graph structure designs and graph algorithms (Applied from
      Graph Theory).
      You can also find some C projects.
      
      
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some medium sized projects (of 3-4 programmers), 
      and would like to receive any coding problem that I will solve and upload into a repo of solutions.
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, Python, and C (And other variants of C).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects.
